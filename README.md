# Overview

This simple project just focuses on applying some different edge detection filters to the video using `OpenCV` and `CustomTkinter`. You can change the filter type and adjust the blur level.

## Edge Detection Filters:

Those are the filters uesd on the program.

- Sobel X
- Sobel Y
- Magnitude
- Sobel with Threshold
- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
