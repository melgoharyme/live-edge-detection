## 🙊 Overview 🙊

This simple project just focuses on applying some different edge detection filters to the video using `OpenCV` and `CustomTkinter`. You can change the filter type and adjust the blur level.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use this simple program to learn kids about computer vision edge detection filters 🫠🫠🫠🧑‍🍼🧑‍🍼.

## 🫵 Edge Detection Filters Used 🫵

Those are the filters uesd on the program.

- Sobel X
- Sobel Y
- Magnitude
- Sobel with Threshold
- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
- Sigma Adjustment: Adjust the blur level using the "+" and "-" keys.

> [!TIP]  
> You can use keyboard shortcuts to run the filters live [`X`, `Y`, `M`, `S`, `L`, `Q`, `+`, `-`] or can use the switch button on the GUI.
